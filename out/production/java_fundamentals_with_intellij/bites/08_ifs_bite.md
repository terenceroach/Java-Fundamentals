Learn to use if statements.

## Introduction

In this section, you'll learn how to build if statements in Java. Let's start by looking at an example and imagine that `weather` is normally set to either `"sunny"`, `"rainy"` or `"cold"`

```java
if(weather == "sunny") {
  System.out.println("Don't forget the suncream :)");
} else if(weather == "rainy") {
  System.out.println("You'll need an umbrella today!");
} else if(weather == "cold") {
  System.out.println("Be sure to wrap up warm");
} else {
  System.out.println("There is nothing remarkable about the weather today. What shall we talk about instead?")
}
```

Broadly speaking they're the same as if statements in Python.

- You must start with an `if`
- You can include an `else if`
- You can include an `else`

There are, however, some differences in the syntax (as you would expect).
- `else if` is the equivalent of `elif`
- You need brackets `()` around conditions i.e. After `if` and `else if`
- You need curly braces `{}` around code blocks

## Exercise

FizzBuzz is a great exercise for practising if statements in a new language. Implement a FizzBuzz class that can give you the right result for one number - it doesn't need to loop through a sequence of numbers.

Your FizzBuzz class should have one static method:
* `play` -> takes one number as an argument and returns either Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz or the input number

**Example output...**

```java
FizzBuzz.play(1) => 1
FizzBuzz.play(3) => Fizz
FizzBuzz.play(5) => Buzz
FizzBuzz.play(15) => FizzBuzz
```

    Your <code>play</code> method has to return either an Integer or a String. Can you represent a String using a number (in a way that is meaningful to humans)? That could be tricky! Could you represent an Integer using a String? Yes, you could! The Integer could be represented as the String "1". So, in Java, how do you convert an Integer to a String? If you can do that, you can ensure that <code>play</code> will always return a String.
