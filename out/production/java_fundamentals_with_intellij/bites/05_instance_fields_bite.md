Learn how to use instance fields

## Introduction

You might have noticed that there's something crucial missing from what we've covered so far - instance variables!

In Java, instance variables (properties that belong to a specific instance of a class) are called instance fields. Using instance fields requires you to learn three things...

1. How to pass values in when creating instances of a class
2. How to assign those values to instance fields
3. How to then use instance fields

### Passing values

Passing values when creating an instance of a class is pretty straightforward, just put them between the parentheses. Imagine we wanted to create an instance of a class called `Post`, providing some content. The code would look something like this...

```java
Post post = new Post("Hello, I'm really enjoying my holidays!");
```

And if you needed to pass in the name of the author as well, you could so something like this...

```java
Post post = new Post("Hello, I'm really enjoying my holidays!", "Phileas Fogg");
```

### Assigning values to fields

In python, you used the `__init__` method to grab values that were passed during instantiation and assign them to instance variables. The Java equivalent is called a constructor method and it's name is always the same as the name of the class. For example...

```java
class Post {
  // a constructor method - is it an instance method or a static method?
  // I've defined it to take two args, content and author
  public Post(String content, String author) {
    // assign instance fields
  }
}
```

In python, you used the keyword `self` to refer to the current instance, when setting instance vars.

```python
self.content = content
self.author = author
```

The Java equivalent is `this`.

```java
this.content = content
this.author = author
```

But, what about the _typing_? Don't we have to declare the _type_ for `content` and `author`? Yes, we do! See below for the full example in Java, which includes type declarations.

```java
class Post {

  // type declarations
  String content;
  String author;

  // constructor
  public Post(String content, String author) {
    // assigning the content instance field
    this.content = content;
    // assigning the author instance field
    this.author = author;
  }
}
```

## Demonstration

## Exercise

Define a class called Quiz. When instantiated, it should take two questions as arguments. For example...

```java
new Quiz("what is the capital of Burkina Faso?", "What is the capital of Bhutan?");
```

There should be two instance methods:

* getQuestionOne -> returns the first question
* getQuestionTwo -> returns the second question

Inside the `main` method, create an instance of Quiz, call the two instance methods and print the return values.

## Challenge

Create a class called `ProgrammingLanguage` which has three instance fields

* `String name`
* `Integer yearOfCreation`
* `String creator`

In the main method, create three instances of the `ProgrammingLanguage` class and print the three instance fields of each one.
